☐ BUG: Pin AABBs do not contribute to component culling (so component is culled whilst pins are still technically on screen)
☐ Add "toggle render stats" to toolbar and have renderer draw the following:
	☐ Total components Vs drawn components (to test culling)
	☐ Component under cursor
☐ Start rendering connections: https://github.com/pkorac/cardinal-spline-js
